          We are building an app that will manage trees that are planted around
          the country. Our solution will provide the user with a system that
          will be able to view tree locations on an interactive map, manage
          staff, manage trees and their state, and then provide the non profit
          org a way to spread their cause online.

          My Team and I have decided to use Angular and Firebase for our
          project. The decision was easy since firebase offers amazing hosting
          and services, like a integrated Database solution, all for free.

          Cloud firestore (firebase's database solution) Was probably the
          biggest factor to why we chose firebase over our initial solution
          Heroku. Heroku is an amazing PaaS but everything they offered their
          users was cut back to ensure users buy the entry level packadge. This
          is not the case with firebase, whick gives you almost everythiing they
          could possibly offer. This is becuase google knows the real money lies
          in bigger companys, so they want to lower the entry barrier with
          firebase's entry level plan to then build an ecosystem and charge you
          when your company exceeds a certain threshhold.

          Firebase Hosting (firebase's hosting solution) was the second biggest
          factor to why we chose firebase over our initial solution Heroku.
          Heroku offered hosting, but put your app offline as soon as it was
          inactive for 15 min. Firebase offerers not only full hosting, but also
          access to https and their CDN caching servers worldwide.

          Angular was ranked the second most used technology after Node.js in
          the 2018 Stack Overflow survey. The reasons for such a high rank are
          clear: this frontend tool is equipped with robust components to help
          developers write readable, maintainable, and easy-to-use code. And
          since its owned by google it has AMAZING integration with firebase.
          <br />
          And thats probably the biggest factor that made the choice for us
